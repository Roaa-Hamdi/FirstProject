<dd>
  <div> This is the most important question in my opinion!</div> 
  <div> many students want to be in this field but they don't know the real reason for this choice  </dive>
  <div><h3> I will talk to you the reasons and the qualifications which make you able to bear the hardships of this field</h3> </div>
  <div>-Love of learning is one of the most important points that anyone who wants to excel in this field should consider, </div> This field is constantly changing and being updated because it is a new and deep field.<div> But don't worry, it's exciting and its achievements are amazing.</div>
<p><div>-Patience is the second most important thing because you will make a lot of mistakes due to the precision of everything in this field.</div>
<div> It comes second after the love of learning because you will automatically be patient with what you love.</div>
<div> But if you don't have a lot of patience, you won't be patient for long. So it would be best if you were patient.</div></p>
